## Get an overview over the project

Grids.email is made from [selfmail](https://selfmail.app) and is a selfmail client. This means you use the selfmail backend to send and receive emails and the grids frontend to manage your account and emails. You can also create a own client with [this guide](https://selfmail.app/blog/create-client-with-selfmail). This project is completely open source and in the basic version free to use. We are working on a paid version with more features because we have also server costs and much more. The selfhosted version is always free and contains all features.
